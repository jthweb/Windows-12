Hey everyone! I'm Jonathan, a high school student tinkering with tech. I am the developer of Windows 12 Concept.

It's free, open-source, and made with ‚ù§Ô∏è.

If you enjoy what I'm brewing up and want to support my work, you can buy me a coffee at [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/deskime). Your feedback and contributions are what keep this project going.
