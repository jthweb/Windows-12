## üì¶ **Installation**



1.  Star the repo and grab the latest release for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/jthweb/Windows-12/releases).
2.  Create a backup of your current theme by going to `Settings > Personalisation > Themes` and click on `|Save Theme|`. Give it a name, and then, right click on your theme, click `|Save theme for sharing|` and export your theme as a `.deskthemepack` file.
3. Run the installer.
4. Run `Windows 12 Configurator.exe` from the start menu and follow all steps shown.
<br>
5. Enjoy your Windows 12 experience! üöÄ

> [!TIP]
> üëÄ Use HackBGRT to change the boot logo to make the experience even more better!
> To do this, use splash.bmp provided from the installed directory.

<br>

## <strike>üì¶</strike> **Uninstallation**

Please remember that **UNINSTALLING Windows 12 will NOT remove** all the changes made by the app. To restore to the old version, use the below codes and/or restore the backups made during the installation.

You can restore the icons using the `Restore` option from the 7tsp Icon Patcher, uninstall the `UltraUXThemePatcher`, uninstall OldNewExplorer/Explorer Blur Mica and replace the current theme with the `.deskthemepack` file that was made earlier during the installation. Also, remove all the shortcuts made from the `shell:startup` folder. Then reboot your computer and then, uninstall Windows 12 from the Start Menu or Control Panel.
<br><br>**OR**<br><br>You can use the code `SFC /scannow` in cmd, to restore the theme and icon much faster. <i>(not recommmended)</i>

>   [!WARNING]
> üîë Remember to follow all the steps provided for each step with extreme care to ensure the app is installed or uninstalled correctly. <br><br>Make sure that you don't reboot your computer any time during the installation, even if the apps ask you to.
