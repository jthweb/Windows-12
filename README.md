<br>
5. Enjoy your Windows 12 experience! üöÄ

> [!TIP]
> üëÄ Use HackBGRT to change the boot logo to make the experience even more better!

### üíª Codes required during installation
```bash
winget install --id=Rainmeter.Rainmeter -e
winget install --id AmN.yasb
```
<br>

## <strike>üì¶</strike> **Uninstallation**

1.  Please remember that **UNINSTALLING Windows 12 will NOT remove** all the changes made by the app. To restore to the old version, use the below codes and restore the backups made during the installation.

### üíª Codes required during uninstallation
```bash
winget uninstall --id=Rainmeter.Rainmeter -e
winget uninstall --id AmN.yasb
``` 

You can restore the icons using the `Restore` option from the 7tsp Icon Patcher, uninstall the `UltraUXThemePatcher`, uninstall OldNewExplorer/Explorer Blur Mica, restore the old `winver.exe` and `run.exe`, and replace the current theme with the `.deskthemepack` file that was made earlier during the installation. Also, remove all the shortcuts made from the `shell:startup` folder. Then reboot your computer and then, uninstall Windows 12 from the Start Menu or Control Panel.
<br><br>**OR**<br><br>You can use the code `SFC /scannow` in cmd, to restore the theme and icon much faster. <i>(not recommmended)</i>

>   [!WARNING]
> üîë Remember to follow all the steps provided for each step with extreme care to ensure the app is installed or uninstalled correctly. <br><br>Make sure that you don't reboot your computer any time during the installation, even if the apps ask you to.
