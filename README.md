## 👋 Welcome

Hi there! I’m Jonathan — a high school student who’s passionate about design, productivity, and everything Windows. This project, **Windows 12 Concept**, is my vision for a cleaner, smarter, and more user-centric Windows experience.

It’s free, open-source, and made with ❤️ for the community. If you enjoy it and want to support the project, consider buying me a coffee at [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jthweb).

## 📍 Project Overview

**Windows 12 Concept** is a UI/UX experiment that imagines what a refined version of Windows could look like. From visuals to user flow, every aspect has been reconsidered to enhance usability and give your desktop a fresh look.

This is not an operating system — it is a **customization layer** with themes, widgets, and utilities that enhance the visual and functional experience of Windows 10/11.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Windows Intelligence**  
  Integrated with [Writing Tools](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools) to provide intelligent writing support directly on your desktop.

- **Quick Bar**  
  Speedy access to your favorite apps and commands to keep you efficient and focused.

- **Redesigned Interface**  
  Includes a refined File Explorer, themed icons, and clean wallpapers by [Addy Visuals](https://youtube.com/@addyvisuals).

- **Modern Run App**  
  A fully revamped Run interface supporting drag-and-drop, inline command suggestions, and persistent actions.

- **Time Widgets**  
  Stay on top of your schedule with Rainmeter widgets seamlessly blended into the desktop environment.

- **Start Menu Reimagined**  
  Designed for productivity: flyouts for quick tasks and a volume mixer that’s actually usable.

- **Hover-Activated Taskbar**  
  A dock-like taskbar that appears only when needed — clean, functional, intuitive.

- **Easy Configuration Tool**  
  Quickly customize your experience with the Windows 12 Configurator.

- **Custom `winver.exe`**  
  A polished and personalized version information utility.

- **🎥 Coming Soon**: **Video Wallpaper Support**
